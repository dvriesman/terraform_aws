This is a simple container with NGNIX + a HTML to just a small test.

> I create a new image from this Dockerfile using command below: 

**docker build -t dvriesman/myterraformtestc:latest .**

After that I sent to registry: 

docker push dvriesman/myterraformtestc:latest

This container is now published and available to deploy on AWS.
